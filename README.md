# Acme Air Sample and Benchmark

This application shows an implementation of a fictitious airline called "Acme Air".  The application was built with the some key business requirements: the ability to scale to billions of web API calls per day, the need to develop and deploy the application in public clouds (as opposed to dedicated pre-allocated infrastructure), and the need to support multiple channels for user interaction (with mobile enablement first and browser/Web 2.0 second).

There are two implementations of the application tier. Each application implementation, supports multiple data tiers.  They are:
- **Node.js**
  - MongoDB
  - Cloudant
- **Java**
  - WebSphere Liberty Profile to Mongodb

## Repository Contents
